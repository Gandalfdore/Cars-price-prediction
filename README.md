# Car Price Determination Project

This project aims to determine car prices using data science techniques. It involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), building machine learning models, and deploying a web application to predict car prices.

## Overview

The project is structured into several components:

- **Presentation document**: Showcasing the findings of the project and the methods that were used.

- **Data Cleaning**: In this phase, the dataset is processed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA is conducted to gain insights into the relationships between different features and the target variable (car prices). Visualizations generated during this phase are stored in the `images` folder.

- **Machine Learning**: Various machine learning models are trained on the cleaned dataset to predict car prices. The models are saved in the `Models` folder.

- **Web Application**: A web application is developed to provide a user-friendly interface for predicting car prices using the trained machine learning model.

- **Synthetic data generator**: A script that uses an LLM to learn and generate more data from a dataframe.

## Repository Structure

- **Notebooks**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for different stages of the project, including data cleaning, EDA, and machine learning.

- **Data**: Contains the dataset used in the project.

- **Models**: Contains saved machine learning models.

- **Images**: Stores images generated during the EDA phase.
